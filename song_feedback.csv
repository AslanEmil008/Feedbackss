"Hi Aspen Jade, thanks for sharing your music with us. Your song ""Obsessed"" offers a nice Dance Pop type of sound. First I would like to highlight the chorus which is very well thought out and catchy. The instrumental is very good and the vocal performance is super accomplished as well. The production in general is good and it's a well done composition. Personally I wouldn't change anything, it's very good. But unfortunately I have to inform you that I won't be able to share your song because we are looking for more Indie Pop or Dream Pop projects with a more melancholic or dramatic mood and your song is more of a Dance Pop.

The song transmits a lot of feeling and the combination of the very professional voice, the stylish instrumental and the very proffunate lyrics manages to send a very clear message. I really like the chorus, I think the positive thing is that many people who are in that phase of falling in love can identify with the message of this very obsessed with you .

"""Obsessed"" by Aspen Jade is a compelling composition that delves into the theme of fixation with a unique musical flair. While the song showcases notable strengths, there are certain elements that, when refined, could amplify its overall impact. The production quality of the track is commendable, offering a well-crafted sonic backdrop that suits the theme. However, there's an opportunity to explore a more expansive dynamic range. Introducing moments of subtle build-ups or drops could add emotional depth, creating a more engaging listening experience and emphasizing the intensity of the fixation portrayed in the song. Lyrically, ""Obsessed"" presents an intriguing narrative, but there's room for greater lyrical precision. Some verses could benefit from more vivid imagery or metaphorical language to intensify the emotional connection. Strengthening the lyrical depth could enhance the storytelling aspect of the song, allowing listeners to immerse themselves more fully in the theme of obsession. Aspen Jade's vocal delivery is expressive and well-suited to the song's mood. However, there are moments where vocal phrasing could be further refined for a smoother flow. Addressing these nuances through careful vocal control or post-production adjustments could enhance the overall cohesion of the vocal performance. The song's structure is well-conceived, guiding the listener through the emotional landscape. Yet, there's an opportunity to experiment with arrangement to maintain interest. Introducing subtle variations or unexpected shifts in instrumentation could add an extra layer of intrigue, contributing to the overall complexity of the composition. In conclusion, ""Obsessed"" by Aspen Jade is a captivating piece with a distinctive theme. By exploring a more expansive dynamic range, refining lyrical precision, addressing vocal phrasing, and experimenting with arrangement, the song could reach new artistic heights. This is the reason why I decided not to feature the song. Nevertheless, we appreciate your submission and encourage continued exploration and refinement in your musical endeavors.",I am 101% in love with you,Fail,Obsessed,"Ambient, Chill out, Commercial / Mainstream, Dance music, Deep house, French house, House music, Instrumental, International pop, Singer songwriter, Catchy, Chill, Downbeat, Good vibes, Unique, Mainstream, Melancholic, Melodic, Dreamy, Original, Positive, Relaxing, Romantic, Sensual, Tropical, Acoustic guitar, Autotune, Bass guitar, Covers, Electric guitar, Electronic sounds, Radio edit, Remix, Synths, All supports, Available on Spotify, Composer"

"hey, thanks for sending :) I like how you described it as a ""make out at the club"" track. I think that's an apt description and your voice will really speak to audiences. I was a bit dissapointed by the production though. the stutter house style is a bit overdone in my opinion. I think the drops were good, but the verses felt a bit too dark and empty to me.

"Hello Aspen Jade, Thanks for sending your music into us curators here at Groover. I've been listening through to ""Infinite."" I like the direction you're going in, and I appreciate the style of the vocals; they feel very current and fit well with the Electro Pop genre. If you don't mind, I'd like to make a couple of points about the mix that I noticed. The vocal performance is good, and the 'slight mumble' style gives the music an attitude and edge. However, if I were mixing this, I'd bring the vocal out more, letting it stand and be bolder, sitting right at the forefront. Although a lot of club systems are still in mono, having a good stereo mix is essential. I noticed a lot of sounds sitting in the center of the mix. You could really bring out some more interesting elements by panning the non-stereo sounds to different points in the stereo field, which will also help separate things away from the vocal. In the low mids, there's a lot of information that, to my ears, needs to be tamed a touch more to generate a bit of clarity. I also noticed there's a reverse low end that comes in at points, particularly around 52 seconds, repeating. While I like this element, it creates a lot of mud and detracts from the bass. As an experiment, it might be worth seeing what it sounds like without the reverse bass at moments when everything's playing. These are just my thoughts listening on my monitor sets with fresh, independent ears. Please feel free to ignore any of the above if you disagree—they are intended to help and provide food for thought for future recordings or remixes. For the above reasons, I won't be sharing, but keep doing what you're doing. You are talented and have everything there; just a few tweaks and your music will really take off.

There are musical ideas that work but I think it is a very diffuse song and it is not very clear, the production is perhaps exaggerated and sounds too processed for the musical style.

While it is a minimalist style, there isn't much else there beyond the looping style of melody. Save for the short inclusion of some shimmering synth effects towards the end, anyways.

"Hey Aspen, I really like the unique sound of this, I can certainly hear Imogen Heap as an influence in this sound. It's really strong, and the emotional impact of this is good! I was on the fence about this one, in truth. We receive hundreds of submissions a week, so it's hard for us to choose which to place, and it has to be perfect. We looked at what part of the audio is being used in the TikTok official audio, and it isn't something that starts with something immediately hooky/grabbing. Perhaps if it was the part of the song where you said ""of course I kept all your photos"", then maybe that could be something we could use. But it currently starts midway through an ""OOO"" sound.

"Hi, Aspen Jade. The vocal harmonies that introduce the track are of high quality and introduce a very energetic and emotive rhythm to the song. The melodies incorporate synthetic elements very well and have strong moments, but the overall production is a bit distant from the melancholic and sad atmosphere I'm looking for in the playlist. However, the mood that this track conveys to me is not the ideal that I'm looking for in my playlist - I'm searching for more down and sad tracks, with a dramatic and emotional production. The song didn't match the atmosphere that I'm searching for in my playlist. The song is great though, I wish you all the best. You are very talented.
